<p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">A Chicano member of New Mexico’s <a href="http://econtent.unm.edu/cdm/ref/collection/acpa/id/9443" target="_blank">Reality Construction Company</a> commune told a visiting reporter, “Every time a white hippie comes in and buys a Chicano’s land to escape the fuckin’ city, he sends that Chicano to the city to go through what he’s trying to escape from, can you dig it? What can you do with that bread out here, man? Nothing. Then when that money’s gone, see, the Chicano has to stay in the city, cause now he ain’t got no land to come back to. He’s stuck, and the hippie’s free. That’s why they don’t dig the fuckin’ hippies, man.”</span> [Page 78]</p>
