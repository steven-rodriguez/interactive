    <h1>Reading response A</h1>
    <p>Nilas: I think it’s about the individual freedom in what you want. For some people, it makes sense. I know
people in my class, our class, who document stuff and put it online and as they are here. I personally don't
do it. Growing up with the internet in the way that we all have here, we’re all changing our approaches to it.
For example, Facebook is suddenly a lot bigger than it was when we joined. Once you put something out
there, you lose control of it, and maybe some of us are hesitant about being public with stuff because we
felt we’ve lost control of things. Especially in an educational situation, where you are here to change or
develop, you might not relate or identify with the work you did two years before you came here, because
being here can elicit a significant development. But also after your time here, you might develop further. If
you’re a person who changes so much, then the identification, the internet as a mirror, can be frustrating.</p>
<br><p> Steven: I have a similar anxiety and hesitation around publishing my work online, which has really intensified alongside the way we use the internet has shifted in the last few years. The types of relationships/interactions that could be forged which once excited me around personal publishing platforms (i.e. blogs and than social media) seems to have been eclipsed by a new field of competition/personal brand mining, that feels insincere and caught in producing a monolithic sameness. I do wish there was a platform for me to share my work/process in smooth sincere private channels, which would guarantee a type of control over context. Haven't really figured out how to do that in a productive way yet. Also for me with the type of design work I’ve done in the past with collectives and political projects it has been important for me to retain a level of anonymity & control over the context my work is seen a) because there is a lot of career-based cultural capital that can be attained by working within a proximity to these types of projects and is often exploited by artists/designers as a way to climb public career/social ladders off the energy/labor of larger movements or collective work. b) also w/ all the internet doxing there is also question of security. I guess using the internet as an artist/designer right now really forces you to have some clarity around long term motivations, which I don't feel totally prepared to make decisions about.  </p>
